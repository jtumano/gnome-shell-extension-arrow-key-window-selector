ARROW-KEY-WINDOW-SELECTOR

This extension allows you to select windows in overview
mode with the arrow keys of your keyboard. When you
are in overview mode and press an arrow key, the
most recently focused window will be selected and
highlighted. As soon as you have navigated to the desired
window you can press ENTER for activating the window or
DELETE for closing it. Mouse events and other key events
will terminate the selection process.

Contribution by Tim Cuthbertson:
Switch workspaces in overview mode mit PG_UP and PG_DOWN. 

INSTALLATION:

Create a folder in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
called arrow-key-window-selector@tanwald.net and move
extension.js and metadata.json into that folder. Restart
the gnome-shell.
